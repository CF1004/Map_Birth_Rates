# 🌍 Global Birth Rates — Interactive Tableau Dashboard  

An interactive data visualization built in **Tableau**, showing global birth rates by country.  
Includes dynamic controls to explore **temporal** and **threshold-based** patterns.

## 🎯 Overview  

This dashboard visualizes how birth rates vary across the world and over time.  
You can:  
- Use the **Year Slider** (top right) to change the displayed year.  
- Adjust the **Birth Rate Threshold Slider** to redefine what counts as a “High” vs “Low” birth rate.  
  - Sliding **left** increases the number of blue countries (higher birth rates).  
  - Sliding **right** increases the number of green countries (lower birth rates).

## 🧭 Features  

- **Interactive Year Filter** — explore changes from 1960–2020 (or available range).  
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment** — fine-tune how countries are categorized by birth rate.  
- **Color-coded Choropleth Map** — instantly see global birth rate distribution.  
- **Data-driven Labels** — shows birth rate percentages directly on the map.
